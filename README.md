# Indoor Long-term Re-identification Wardrobe Dataset

We present a video dataset composed of 25 people, walking along an indoor corridor which is in the Computer Science and Engineering building at UB, with varied clothing appearances. In consideration for long term re-id we collected the data once every day, for 30 days, using a single camera.

Currently, we are currently in the process of setting up a location in UB's servers which can host the file. 
Once done, we will publish the link in github.

For any question, please contact me at klee43 at buffalo dot edu.
