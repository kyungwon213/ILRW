# Indoor Long-term Re-identification Wardrobe Dataset (ILRW)

We present a video dataset composed of 25 people, walking along an indoor corridor, with varied clothing appearances. In consideration for long term re-id we col- lected the data once every day, for 30 days, using a single camera. We term this dataset as “Indoor Long-term Re- identification Wardrobe (ILRW)” dataset.
